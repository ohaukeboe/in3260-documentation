  abstract = {Issues in local area networks can be manifold, and most users lack the expertise or data needed to be able to deduce whether a problem arose in the local wireless network or elsewhere in the Internet path. This thesis introduces NETHINT – a novel tool that listens to wireless local area network traffic and collects long-term statistics such as delay and packet loss. These statistics can help pinpoint the origin of such problems. NETHINT presents them in a way that is easily parsable and exportable. Using reliable sources of metrics, it compiles a repository of accumulated data and lays a foundation for future statistic correlation methods.},

  abstract = {This technical report describes how we setup a TEACUP v0.8 testbed to conduct automated TCP experiments. Over the last few decades several TCP congestion control algorithms were developed in order to optimise TCP’s behaviour in certain situations. While TCP was traditionally used mainly for file transfers, more recently it is also used for streaming applications, for example YouTube or Netflix [1], [2]. Now there is even an ISO standard called Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) [3]. However, the impact of different TCP congestion control algorithms on TCP-based streaming flows (within a mix of other typical traffic) is not well understood. TEACUP experiments in a controlled testbed allow shedding more light on this issue.},

  abstract = {Due to the rapid increase in the speed as well as the number of users over the Internet, the rate of data generation is enormously grown. In addition, at the same rate, the multimedia transmission especially the usage of VoIP calls is rapidly growing due to its cost effectiveness, dramatic functionality over the traditional telephone network and its compatibility with public switched telephone network (PSTN). In most of the developing countries, internet service providers (ISPs) and telecommunication authorities are concerned in detecting such calls to either block or prioritize commercial VoIP. Signature-based, port-based, and pattern-based detection techniques are inaccurate due to the complex and confidential security and tunneling mechanisms used by VoIP. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a generic, robust, efficient statistical analysis-based solution to identify encrypted and tunneled voice media flows. We extracted six statistical parameters, which are extracted for each flow and compared with threshold values while generating a number of rules to identify VoIP media calls. The paper also offers a complete architecture that can efficiently process high-speed traffic in order to detect VoIP flows at real-time. The proposed system, including the architecture and the algorithm, can be practically implemented in a real environment, such as ISP or telecommunication authority’s gateway. We implemented the system using the parallel environment of Hadoop ecosystem with Spark on the top of it to achieve the real-time processing. We evaluated the system by considering 1) the accuracy in terms of detection rate by computing the direct rate and false positive rate and 2) the efficiency in terms of processing power. The result shows that the system has 97.54\% direct rate and .00015\% false positive rate, which are quite high. The comparative study proved that the proposed system is more accurate than the existing techniques.},
