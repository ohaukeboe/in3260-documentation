  abstract = {Issues in local area networks can be manifold, and most users lack the expertise or data needed to be able to deduce whether a problem arose in the local wireless network or elsewhere in the Internet path. This thesis introduces NETHINT – a novel tool that listens to wireless local area network traffic and collects long-term statistics such as delay and packet loss. These statistics can help pinpoint the origin of such problems. NETHINT presents them in a way that is easily parsable and exportable. Using reliable sources of metrics, it compiles a repository of accumulated data and lays a foundation for future statistic correlation methods.},

  abstract = {This technical report describes how we setup a TEACUP v0.8 testbed to conduct automated TCP experiments. Over the last few decades several TCP congestion control algorithms were developed in order to optimise TCP’s behaviour in certain situations. While TCP was traditionally used mainly for file transfers, more recently it is also used for streaming applications, for example YouTube or Netflix [1], [2]. Now there is even an ISO standard called Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) [3]. However, the impact of different TCP congestion control algorithms on TCP-based streaming flows (within a mix of other typical traffic) is not well understood. TEACUP experiments in a controlled testbed allow shedding more light on this issue.},
